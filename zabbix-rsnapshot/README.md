rsnapshot backup monitoring
===========================

Check rsnapshot enabled backup (discovery) and related results.

Some checks were just taken from the original script without check. The template does LLD and checks every hour for the status.


Requires packages libfile-readbackwards-perl and libtimedate-perl installed (this is how Ubuntu/Debian calls them)
